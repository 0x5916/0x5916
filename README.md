### 🎉 Fun Fact
My coding adventure began in 2021 on my first laptop - FUJITSU U537 with an Intel i5-7200U CPU.
Fun part: the CPU's device ID is 0x5916, which became my GitHub username! (Bonus: No one’s spotted that easter egg yet)

### 🎮 What I'm Playing
When I'm not glued to my code editor, I'm gaming hard:
1. **Music Games:** Arcaea, Phigros, ADOFAI, Paradigm:Reboot
2. **Zenless Zone Zero**
3. **Shapez 2** (a factory-building game all about shapes)
4. A mix of visual novel games

Thanks for visiting!
I'm constantly tinkering with new projects and ideas. If anything catches your eye, let's team up and create something awesome! 🚀
